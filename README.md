# face_mask_detection

Creating a face mask detection project with Teachable Machine involves these steps: collect images of people with and without masks, train a model using Teachable Machine's drag-and-drop interface, test and refine the model's accuracy, and export it for deployment. Integration into applications involves capturing live video, processing frames to detect masks, and optionally creating a user interface to display results. Challenges include ensuring accuracy in different conditions and optimizing for real-time performance. Future enhancements could include multi-person detection and mask quality assessment features. Overall, Teachable Machine simplifies machine learning model development for beginners, facilitating rapid prototyping of applications like face mask detection.
